<p><b>Who can play?</b><br>
Any female affiliated with the University of Chicago: students, alumnae, faculty, staff, etc. We're not picky.</p>

<p><b>Which teams do we compete against?</b><br>
During the fall/winter season, we play various other university club teams, such as Northwestern University and the Loyola University, as well as local-area recreational teams (Chicago, Evanston, Homewood-Flossmoor, Northbrook, Crystal Lake, etc). We carpool to games and always make sure there's room for everyone. In the spring and summer, there are leagues in the Chicago area that the team usually has players sign up to play.  Some of them have included leagues at Johnny's in the west loop, Evanston, and Northbrook.</p>

<p><b>How often do we play?</b><br>
We start in mid-October and during the fall/winter season we generally have 3-4 games per month. In the spring, depending on the league, there are usually one or two games a week. Check out our <a
href="index.html">schedule</a> for more information. We have practices depending on ice availability.  We practice at Niles during the fall and outside on the Midway Plaisance Rink in the winter.</p>

<p><b>How good do I have to be?</b><br>
We take players of <i>all</i> levels, and strongly encourage beginners to join. If you've always wanted to play ice hockey but never had the opportunity before, join the team!
We'll teach you everything you need to know to get started, including skating, stick-handling, and game play.  The team is all about having fun and enjoying the great sport of hockey and of course going out to beat up on the other team and win the trophy.</p>

<p><b>What do I need to play?</b><br>
Although every player has to have a full set of hockey equipment, don't worry if you don't have any to start with &mdash; we can lend you some to try until you can buy you own. Used equipment is available for cheap from stores like Play It Again Sports or other hockey players who are selling off their old equipment (although we recommend getting your own new skates). A full set shouldn't cost more than about $200 to $300 tops, and you'll be able to wear it for years.</p>

<p><b>How much does it cost?</b><br>
Dues for members have cost only <b>$60</b> a quarter! (This is very cheap as many other clubs cost more than 3 times as much.) If you are a driver or if you are a new player buying equipment, you do not have to pay dues that quarter. We also supplement our funds with fundraising and sponsors.</p>

<p><b>Why should I play?</b><br>
Well, besides the fact that we're a hell of a lot of fun to hang around, everyone knows that women who play ice hockey are <i>really damn cool</i>. Think about most sports (e.g. baseball, golf, even football) and the level of excitement just can't compete.   </p>

<p><b>How do I sign up?</b><br> Send an email to the team captain Nora at <a href="mailto:nrcorcoran@uchicago.edu?subject=Ice Hockey">nrcorcoran@uchicago.edu</a> to let her know you're interested. Also, check our website for more information.</p>

 <p><em>"Skate smoothly, but carry a big stick."</em></P>
