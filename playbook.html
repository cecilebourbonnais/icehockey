<h2>Important Rules - <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QKb8ngEucw&feature=related">Video</a></h2>
<img align="right" src="img/hockeyrink.jpg" style="height:300px; padding-left:20px"></img>
<h4>Offsides</h4>
<P>The basic rule is that the puck must enter the offensive zone before ANY of the offensive players do.  If the puck does go while an offensive person(s) is in the zone then all offensive players must "tag up" and leave the zone before any of the offensive players enter the zone again.
<P>Here's a link to the <a href="http://www.nhl.com/ice/page.htm?id=26497">NHL rule</a> which explains it in great detail. 

<h4>Icing</h4>
It is a great idea to dump the puck into the offensive zone (the other team then has their backs to us) but you cannot just dump it from anywhere.  You must cross the center red line before you dump the puck or it is considered icing.  So if the puck crosses the center red line and then the goal line (2 red lines) without touching anyone then it's icing.
<P>Here's a link to the <a href="http://www.nhl.com/ice/page.htm?id=26494">NHL rule</a> which explains it in great detail. In our league, as soon as the puck crosses the goal line it's icing, no player has to touch it.

<h4>Penalties</h4>
In ice hockey, a penalty results in a player spending time in the penalty box (in our league it's for 1:30). Ice hockey has three types of penalties: minor, major, and misconduct. The harsher the penalty, the harsher the punishment. Hockey penalties include:
<ul>
<li><strong> Butt ending:</strong>  When a player jabs an opponent with the top end of his stick.</li>
<li><strong> Checking:</strong>  In women's hockey there is no checking (aka no hitting) but contact is allow. </li> 
<li><strong> Elbowing:</strong>  When a player uses his elbow to foul an opponent.</li>
<li><strong> Fighting:</strong>  It is assessed when players drop their gloves and throw punches at each other. In our league fighting is not tollerated.</li>
<li><strong> Hooking:</strong>  When a player impedes the progress of an opponent by “hooking” him with his stick.
<li><strong> Interference:</strong>  When a player interferes with or impedes the progress of an opponent who does not have the puck. Also assessed to a player who deliberately knocks the stick out of an opponent’s hand or who prevents a player who has dropped his stick (or any other piece of equipment) from picking it back up.</li>
<li><strong> Roughing:</strong>  Called when a player strikes another opponent in a minor altercation that the referee determines is not worthy of a major penalty.</li>
<li><strong> Slashing:</strong>  When a player hits an opponent with his stick, or “slashes” him, either to impede his progress or cause injury.</li>
<li><strong> Tripping:</strong>  When a stick or any portion of a player’s body is used to cause an opposing player to fall.</li>
</ul>

<h2>General Play</h2>

<h4>Positions Explained</h4>
An ice hockey team is made up of six players, each with a specific position and job. The job of offense is to score goals, and the defense is there to protect the goal. The following list describes each of the hockey positions:
<ul>
<li><strong>Goalie:</strong>  Perhaps the toughest position in all of sports, the goalie is the one player who can control a team’s confidence. Her job is to keep the puck out of the net.</li>
<li><strong>Defensemen:</strong>  A team at full strength has two — one on the left side and another on the right. Nowadays, there are three primary kinds of defensemen. One is creative and offensive-minded; he likes to handle the puck and lead the team up ice, but is not too physical. Another is defensive-minded, a stay-at-home bruiser who plays a physical game and doesn’t often venture out of his zone with the puck. And there are those rare athletes who are a combination of the two.</li>
<li><strong>Right wing:</strong>  She works the right side of the ice for the most part. She needs to be a physical player who is good along the boards and in the corner. She is responsible for the opposition’s left defenseman in the defensive zone.</li>
<li><strong> Left wing:</strong>  Traditionally a left-handed shot, but the NHL is seeing more right-handers playing this position now, a practice picked up from the Europeans. A right-hander has a better angle to shoot from when he’s coming in on his wing. Like the right wing, he needs to be able to dig out the puck from the corners and battle in front of the net.</li>
<li><strong>Center:</strong> She quarterbacks the team at both ends of the ice. Must be good at face-offs and passing, and it doesn’t hurt if she's a good shot as well. Coaches want a lot of creativity in this position — and a lot of hockey smarts.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Periods and Direction of Play</h4>
<P>Hockey has three periods.  Our league has usually 11 minute periods with a 1 minute rest period in between.  The side our bench is on is going to be our defensive zone for the first period and third periods.  For the second period, the direction of play reverses and our defensive zone is on the opposite side of our bench, which will make it harder and longer for players to change shifts.

<h4>Shifts</h4>
<P>Hockey is fast paced and players stay on the ice for about 30 seconds at a time (a shift) before switching (in our league it's more like 1 minute shifts).  There are two ways to change shifts either during a whistle (play is stopped and there's a face-off) or on the fly.  To change on the fly, the player comes to the bench (one player a time or the other team will have a big advantage) and shouts out their position so that the player who needs to come on next gets ready.  The player coming in jumps over the boards as the player going out does the same (can use the doors but it's better not to).  This doesn't have to happen exactly at the same time but about at the same time.  It is best to change on the fly when the puck has been dumped into the offensive zone or while we are in the offensive zone.  Avoid changing on the fly when in our defensive zone.

<h4>Face-Offs</h4>

<h3>Play in the Defensive Zone</h3>
To score, we need to keep the puck out of our zone (the defensive zone) and into the other team's zone the offensive zone. In the defensize zone the main goal is to get the puck out (across the blue line into the neutral zone) if we have control of the puck and if we don't have the puck not let the other team score by picking up a player (marking, defending, man-on-man coverage).

<h3>The Breakout---At last, getting it out of our zone</h3>

<P>
This link has some reading about breakouts with a video at the end with a good explanation too.  It's for a drill but applies to the game situation when the other team dumps the puck into our defensive zone and we need to get out (aka break it out).<P>
It also applies when we are in our defensive zone and steal the puck from the other team and gain possession.  In this case instead of coming from the neutral zone to the your position's spot you just go from where you're at to your spot on the breakout.

<h3>Play in the Offensive Zone</h3>
Now that we've stolen the puck and broke out of zone we need to get it into our zone and score.  This is where hockey creativity in good.  The basics are that there are two defense at the top of the zone, one in the middle of the ice and one by the boards on the side of the ice with the puck.  These two move back and forth depending on where the puck is and their job is to keep it in the zone and be open for a pass from the forwards. The forwards need to be creative and keep moving at all times to make it hard for the other team to defend you; on this end of the ice it doesn't matter if you're left wing, right wing, or center, you'll be moving around everywhere.  The best is to have the three forwards in the formation of a triangle so that there are multiple passing options.  No on in the triangle should be even with another forward in either across the width or the length of the ice.  Usually one person is in front of the net, one person along the goaline and one person near the boards up towards the tops of the circles. One typical thing to do on offense is cycling.  The videos here are for drills but you can do it in the games.  The triangle one you see that the end formation is a triangle.

<a name="penaltyplay"></a><br><br><a href="#">Top</a><br><hr> 
<h3>What happens during a Penality</h3>
The person who committed the penalty is in the box so that team is down a person and only gets four skaters, the other team still has five skaters.  The team with five skaters is on a power play; the other team is on a penalty kill.

<h4>Penalty Kill</h4>
<P>Usually we'll be in our defensize zone since we're down a player, in that case the simplest defense is called the box and you defend the slot (area in front of the net) by staying in a box formation.  If we get control of the puck we'll want to ice the puck because when you're down a player icing does NOT apply.  
<P>When the puck is in our offensive zone we'll only want one person to go into the zone and the others to hang back.  If we have the puck that one person is basically on their own to keep control of it and not let the other team have it.  If we don't have the puck, we are trying to pressure the other team into giving us the puck or being able to steal it back, this is called a forecheck.

<h4>Power Play</h4>
<P>When on the power play we should be able to keep control of the puck and stay in the offensive zone since we've got an extra person. If it's not in our offensize zone we'll need to take control of the puck and breakout of our defensive end and into the offensive end.  If we don't have control of the puck we need to have TWO people going after the puck since we've got an extra person we can afford to have two people converge on the puck.  If we have control of the puck in the defensive end then we should breakout the puck and get into the offensive zone.
<P>Once in the offensize zone there are several formations to be in.  Coach will pick on of these for us to use.
